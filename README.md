# Key Components
data/: Holds the dataset files. It might contain scripts to download or generate data, preprocess it, and organize it into train/validation/test splits.

models/: Contains the PyTorch model definitions. Each model can have its own file, making it easy to manage multiple model architectures.

utils/: Stores utility functions and classes that are used across the project. This could include data transformations, loss functions, or helper functions for visualization.

configs/: Configuration files or scripts can define hyperparameters, model settings, and other configurations that might change between experiments.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model development, visualization, and presenting results in an interactive format.

results/: Used to save outputs of the model training and evaluation processes, such as model checkpoints, logs, and any generated plots or analysis reports.

train.py: The main script for training models. It sets up the dataset, model, loss function, optimizer, and controls the training loop.

evaluate.py: Script for evaluating the trained model on a test set or with specific evaluation metrics. It loads a model checkpoint and computes performance metrics.

requirements.txt: Lists the project dependencies. This file is used to ensure that anyone who works on the project can install the necessary libraries easily.

README.md: A markdown file providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, how to run the scripts, and any other relevant information.

# Usage
Training: Run python train.py with any necessary arguments or configurations to train your model.
Evaluation: After training, evaluate your model on test data by running python evaluate.py, which should load the model and compute relevant metrics.
This structure is flexible and can be adapted based on the project's specific needs, the complexity of the models, and the size of the team working on it. It’s designed to keep the code organized, make experiments easily reproducible, and facilitate collaboration among multiple contributors.
